## **Description**

Peerfolio is a platform designed for students to showcase their creativity and achievements. Students can create and publish their own posts—whether it's a project, artwork, writing, or other accomplishments. Teachers can then review these posts and select outstanding ones to be featured in the official Yearbook section, creating a collaborative and curated digital portfolio that celebrates student work throughout the year.
